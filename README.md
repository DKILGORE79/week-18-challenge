## Description:
This is a set of API for a social network that uses a MongoDB database so that the website can handle large amounts of unstructured data, Express.js for routing, Mongoose ODM, and the moment package to format time stamps.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- When you enter the command to invoke the application then the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.  
- Testing API GET routes in Insomnia Core for users and thoughts return the data for each of these routes in a formatted JSON
- Testing API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core are able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts

- Testing API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core are able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list.
